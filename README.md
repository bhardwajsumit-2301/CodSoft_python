CODSOFT - Python Internship Projects
This repository contains all the tasks and mini-projects completed during my CodSoft Python Development Internship. These projects focus on building a strong foundation in core Python concepts through simple, real-world applications.

🐍 Included Python Projects:

🧮 Basic Calculator
A command-line calculator that performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project focuses on handling user input, applying conditional logic, and delivering clean, formatted output.

🔐 Password Generator
An application that generates strong, random passwords based on user-defined length and complexity. This project utilizes Python’s random and string modules, emphasizing practical security awareness and modular code design.

✊ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A simple yet engaging game where users compete against the computer. It features randomized choices, logical game rules, and optional score tracking across rounds. This project reinforces control flow, loops, and interactive user input handling.
