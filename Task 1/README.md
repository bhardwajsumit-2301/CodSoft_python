    ➕ Addition (`+`)
    ➖ Subtraction (`-`)
    ✖️ Multiplication (`*`)
    ➗ Division (`/`)

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python **3.x**
* Works on **any terminal** or **command prompt**

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the code to a file named `calculator.py`
2. Open your terminal or command prompt
3. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## 💻 Sample Output

```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 2
Select operation:
Addition(+)
Subtraction(-)
Multiplication(*)
Division(/)

## 📌 Notes

* If the user selects `/` and the second number is `0`, the program will safely warn against division by zero.
* If an invalid operator is entered, the program will notify the user and exit gracefully.
